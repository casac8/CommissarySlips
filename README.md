# CommissarySlips
This is the repository for my investigative app called Commissary Slips, which published on Reckon South on 8/19/20. I used Construct 3's version management capabilities and stored the versions on Google Drive while I developed the app, but wanted to post this here in case anyone wants to check out the code underpinning the project.
Here's the link to the final published version of the app: [Commissary Slips](https://reckonsouth.com/how-far-does-15-stretch-behind-bars-in-alabama-find-out-at-a-virtual-prison-commissary/)
